# package_config

Support for working with **Package Configuration** files as described
in the Package Configuration v2 [design document](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/future-releases/language-versioning/package-config-file-v2.md).

This version of the `package_config` package is also available as `package_config_2`,
which can be used by packages which transitively depend on a version of `package_config`
with a version <2.0.0.
